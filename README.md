## Read Books in English  
We created a website that reads books using Web Speech API.  
You can read books, and read a sentence with variety language.  
And you can make your own book to read.
## How to Use
1. In Main Page there are two parts. First, in the 'Read books in English' part, you can select a book, and in the 'Read the text' part, you can enter text to read.  
2. If you select a book in the 'Read books in Engish' part, the cover and text of the book are provided and you can read the text.
3. If you click the 'Make your book' button in the 'Read books in English' part, you can typing or'drag and drop' the text and the cover.
